# ShellScript
In this repo I am adding the basic coding files for beginners to learn ShellScript.

#Using Terminal:

$ touch shellScript        # to create separate directory

$ touch HelloWord.sh       # creating first shellscript file to print HelloWord

$ gedit HelloWord.sh       # the gedit will open file to edit: you will add code and exit

$ ./HelloWord.sh           # direct running the file will give 'permission warning' you will need to change permission

$ chmod +x HelloWord.sh    # You will need to run this command for newfiles once to make it executable

$ ./HelloWord.sh           # the file HelloWord.sh will execute and gives output

Now you are ready to practice the ShellScript in linux terminal.
